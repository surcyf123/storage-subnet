# Whitepaper: Decentralized Data Storage and Retrieval Using Blockchain and AI Models

## Abstract
The modern world is fraught with challenges related to data storage and retrieval, including security, scalability, and efficiency. This whitepaper proposes a novel approach that leverages blockchain technology and Artificial Intelligence (AI) models as "miners" to create a decentralized, secure, and efficient data storage and retrieval ecosystem.

## 1. Introduction
Data storage and retrieval are critical aspects of modern computing, yet current centralized solutions are beset with issues of security, privacy, and efficiency. Decentralized systems like blockchain offer a promising alternative but often lack the speed and efficiency for rapid data retrieval. This paper presents a hybrid approach that incorporates AI models as competitive agents ("miners") focused on efficient data retrieval, judged and rewarded based on a scoring system.

## 2. System Architecture

### Components
- **Blockchain**: Serves as the immutable ledger for storing metadata and transaction history.
- **AI Models**: Act as miners, competing for efficient data retrieval.
- **Validators**: Nodes responsible for confirming the validity of data transactions and scoring AI models. Automates the scoring and reward distribution process.

### Flow
1. User requests data storage or retrieval. The request gets routed through a Bittensor validator.
2. AI models compete to fulfill the request.
3. Validators judge the performance based on predefined metrics, with an initial focus on speed.
4. The models are ranked by these metrics and tao rewards are distributed via yuma consensus.

## 3. Scoring Metrics for AI Models
AI models are scored based on a combination of the following metrics:
- **Speed**: Time taken to retrieve the data. The speed score will follow an exponential decay curve.
- **Accuracy**: Relevance and correctness of the retrieved data. This will be treated as a mask, as wrong data retrieval is useless to the client.
- **To be added**: User Satisfaction (Obtained via user feedback).

## 4. Ranking and Rewards

### Ranking Algorithm
The overall score for each model will be comprised of an exponential moving average score with each score being \\\\( \\text{reward at time 0} \\times e^{-\\text{time}} \\times \\text{relevance mask} \\\\), with decay of alpha = .05.  
The stake-weighted consensus point of weights among validators will linearly correlate to the amount of tao distributed to each miner.

## 6. Benefits
- **Innovation**: Encourages improvement in data retrieval algorithms.
- **Security and Transparency**: Blockchain's immutable nature offers a high level of security.
- **Efficiency**: AI models aim to provide the most efficient data retrieval methods.

---

## 7. Challenges
- **Resource-Intensive**: Potentially high computational power needed.
- **Fairness**: Ensuring a fair and tamper-proof scoring system.

---

## 8. Conclusion
The proposed system aims to revolutionize data storage and retrieval by combining the security and transparency of blockchain with the efficiency and innovation of AI models. Through a competitive, incentivized ecosystem, this approach has the potential to address many of the limitations of current centralized and decentralized data management systems.
